# PS Lab Audition

## Abusing AlwaysInstallElevated for Privilege Escalation

I have provided [instructions](https://github.com/plackyhacker/pslab/blob/main/instructions.md) for the lab.

The lab has been built using Terraform which can be provided upon request, although the [Windows user script](https://github.com/plackyhacker/pslab/blob/main/win-rdp-console.ps1) is also in this repository.
